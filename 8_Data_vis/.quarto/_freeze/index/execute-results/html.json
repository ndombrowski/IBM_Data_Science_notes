You will also learn about the history and the architecture of Matplotlib and learn about basic plotting with Matplotlib. In addition, you will learn about the dataset on immigration to Canada, which will be used extensively throughout the course. Finally, you will briefly learn how to read csv files into a pandas dataframe and process and manipulate the data in the dataframe, and how to generate line plots using Matplotlib.\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n- Describe the importance of data visualization\n- Relate the history of Matplotlib and its architecture\n- Apply Matplotlib to create plots using Jupyter notebooks\n- Read csv files into a Pandas DataFrame; process and manipulate the data in the - DataFrame; and generate line plots using Matplotlib\n\n\n\n",
